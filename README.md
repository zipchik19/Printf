# Printf
This project consists of coding a library that contains a simplified version of the Printf function

#### ft_printf() Available Specifiers:  
`%c` - Prints a single character  
`%s` - Prints a string  
`%p` - Prints a pointer adress  
`%d` or `%i` - Prints a signed integer  
`%u` - Prints an unsigned integer  
`%x` or `%X` - Prints an unsigned integer in hexadecimal format  

#### Makefile Available Targets:  
`make` or `make all` - Makes _libftprintf.a_    
`make clean` - Deletes all the resulting object files  
`make fclean` - Deletes _libftprintf.a_ and all the resulting object files  
`make re` - Deletes everything (object files and _libftprintf.a_) and rebuilds _libftprintf.a_
